# FormBuilder-Azure-MERN

The problem that this project addresses is the absence of a user-friendly, flexible, and customizable form builder tool, resulting in a cumbersome and time-consuming process of creating and managing web forms. This project aims to provide a solution to this problem by developing a Form Builder application that allows users to create custom forms, view form previews, and manage their forms effectively. The existing challenge lies in the complexity of form creation, and the opportunity is to simplify this process, ensuring an intuitive and efficient experience for developers and end-users alike.

n this project, I have developed a Form Builder application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack. The core idea of my project is to offer a web-based platform that allows users to create custom forms, view form previews, and access a list of saved forms. This addresses the problem of tedious and complex form creation, with a primary focus on providing a simplified form creation experience.

I have deployed this application using Azure App Service to ensure its availability and scalability for users. I utilize Azure Advisor to enhance operational efficiency by creating service health alerts, which keep me informed about issues and advisories across four key areas: Service issues, Planned maintenance, Security advisories, and Health advisories. This proactive approach to monitoring and management guarantees a seamless user experience and reinforces the project's reliability.

To ensure the continuous availability of the web app, I've employed Azure Monitor to create alert rules. Whenever the web app stops, I receive email notifications and Azure App push notifications. This integration between Azure Monitor and Azure App Service ensures that the application runs smoothly, and any issues are addressed promptly.
